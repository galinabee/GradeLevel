# demo_fall16
_Demo website for 12/8/16. Please do not change any code in this subdirectory as it is only here as boilerplate_

xml2js works in browser as it is a JavaScript based parser- this may not be the case for other parsers downloaded via NPM

### Setup
1) Download this directory 

2) Use npm install to get dependencies listed in package.json

### Adding/Changing Code
First run "npm run watch" to have code auto built for browser, then make changes to code other than bundle.js
(see package.json and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAa8IcQh1U&index=1&list=PLiyLAgiWnfNH2rlMV7LdZSwnvBGQRoq-Z if confused)

### Execution 
 index.html in the root folder
